TrophyIM is a Jabber (XMPP) client built on top of strophe (http://code.stanziq.com/strophe/).

It is cross-browser compliant and should work in the newer versions of all the major browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera).

Click the source tab to check out the code itself, or you can download the current pre-release version (0.3).  Check for the link to your right.

Installation: simply put trophyim.js in the same directory as your page, add `<script type='text/javascript' src='trophyim.js'></script>` to the header, and put a `<div id='trophyimclient' />` tag in your page wherever you want the client to load.  TrophyIM will handle the rest, including loading strophe, which should be installed in ./strophejs/ relative to where TrophyIM is installed.

Feel free to IM me with any questions or comments, my jabber id is gar AT netflint.net
